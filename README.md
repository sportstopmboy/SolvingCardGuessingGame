# CardGuessingMonteCarlo
<h2>Game Rules</h2>
<p>You are given a standard deck of 52 playing cards which have been shuffled. At the beginning of the game, you make a prediction about how many card colors you are going to be able to correctly predict in a row. Next, you guess the color of the next card in the deck. After you make your guess you draw a card to see if your guess was correct. If your guess was correct, you add one point to your streak of correct guesses. If your guess was incorrect, you reset your streak. You repeat this process until you either run out of cards or your streak reaches the original predicition that you set. If you run out of cards, it means you have lost; and if you correctly predicted your streak, you win.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The question then is: <b>What is the most card colors you can predict whilst expecting to win the majority of games?</b></p>
<p>I first stumbled on this after I saw people using this game to bet on who can guess the most amount of colors in a row. The final prediction was 6 in a row. My intuition said that was silly, but I wanted to prove it.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>The first step to solving this problem is finding the optimal strategy for playing this game. Although it seems like it's all up to chance, there is a way to get an edge. That edge is in predicting the color which has show up less until this point. Since the number of cards in limited, if 2 more red cards have shown up thus far, it is more likely that the next card will be black. This is because the chance is not 50/50 each time, but because we know for a fact that half of the deck is each color. The optimal strategy, therefore, is:
<li><t>As the first guess, pick a random color.</t></li>
<li><t>If the card is black, your next guess is red; and vice versa.</t></li></p>
